# GitHub-Game-Off-2022-Cliche - "I've got a bullet with your name on it"

### A game about bullets and investigation
IBGWYN will be a guess-who/ FPS mashup featuring a top assassin who is tasked with killing the person whose name is inscribed on the bullet of his revolver. 
With no visual ID for your victim, you'll have to go off of dialogue with NPCs. 
You'll be rewarded for killing the correct target, but you have limited time and only one chance.

### Planned Features
  * First-Person Combat
  * Procedurally generated characters
  * Voiced Dialogue
