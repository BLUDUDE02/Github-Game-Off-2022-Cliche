# Github-Game-Off-2022-Cliche - "I've got a bullet with your name on it"

### A game about bullets and investigation
IBGWYN will be a guess who/ FPS mashup featuring a top assassin who is tasked with killing those whose names are inscribed on the bullets of his revolver. with no visual ID for your victims, so you'll have to go off of dialogue with NPCs. You'll be rewarded for killing the correct enemies with the correct bullets but penalized with felony charges for killing the wrong people.

### Planed Features
  * First Person Combat
  * Procedurally generated characters
  * Multiple maps
  * voice lines
